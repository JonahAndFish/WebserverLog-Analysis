1.  Download Process.py and Main.py.

2.  Put the log file that you want to analyse at the same directory as above mentioned files.       TestLog.log is a small webserver log file for testing purpose. Please ensure your log file follows Testlog.log's format for best result.

3.  Open command prompt or terminal and navigate to the same directory.

4.  Type python Main.py -f <name of the log file>. Ensure you have python 2.x installed. 

5.  There are 6 options available to analyse the log file. 

    -u
    Saving unique IP addresses to a flat file.
    
    -c
    Saving unique IP addresses with country and number of hits to a flat file.
    
    -a
    Saving activities per unique IP address to flat files, one file for each IP address. A new directory is created to store those flat files as a huge number of files could be created.

    -s 
    Saving all possible SQL injection entries to a flat file.

    --fi
    Saving all possible remote file inclusion entries to a flat file.
    
    --ws
    Saving all possible web shell entries to a flat file.
    
6.  Example of using: python Main.py -f TestLog.log -c --fi --ws
    It will read TestLog.log file and create three flat files for unique IP addresses with country, remote file inclusion and web shell respectively.
